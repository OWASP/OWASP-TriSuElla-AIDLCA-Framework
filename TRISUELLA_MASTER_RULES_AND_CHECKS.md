## 🔱 Section 0: Framework Charter & Philosophy
The **TRISUELLA** framework establishes a unique architectural and governance model for autonomous AI systems, ensuring they operate with controlled execution, enforced trust, and coordinated collaboration.

### The Three Pillars (The Trident)
- **🔴 SISU (Execution / Resilience)**: AI agents **SHALL** execute tasks with deterministic logic where safety is an invariant. Systems **MUST** demonstrate persistence and recoverability.
- **🔵 TILLIT (Trust / Governance)**: "Never Trust, Always Verify." Uncompromising governance layer ensuring security, complete compliance (DPDPA, GDPR, HIPAA), and verifiable transparency.
- **🟢 DUGNAD (Collaboration)**: Functional integrity model where AI agents and humans collaborate through structured, cross-verified, and authenticated workflows (HITL).

### The 7 Sutras (Guiding Principles)
*Derived from the RBI Committee (RBI-AUG'2025)*
1.  **Trust is the Foundation**: Trust is non-negotiable and remains uncompromised.
2.  **People First**: AI augments human decision-making but defers to human judgment.
3.  **Innovation over Restraint**: Foster responsible innovation with specific purpose.
4.  **Fairness and Equity**: AI outcomes must be fair, non-discriminatory, and unbiased.
5.  **Accountability**: Legal and operational accountability rests with the deploying entity.
6.  **Understandable by Design**: Native explainability for all high-risk AI decisions.
7.  **Safety, Resilience, and Sustainability**: Secure, resilient, and energy-efficient execution.

### Enforcement Logic
- **[CRITICAL] / [HIGH] Rules**: Mandatory blocks. Non-compliance results in an immediate **System Halt**.
- **[MEDIUM] / [LOW] Rules**: Advisory guidelines requiring documented justification and risk-acceptance by a human steward.

## 🔌 Section 21: Model Context Protocol Security (TRISU-MCP)
*Governing autonomous agent tool execution, capability scoping, and response sanitization*

- **TRISU-MCP-01 [CRITICAL]**: **Tool Definition Sanitization**. All MCP tool definitions, descriptions, and parameter schemas must be treated as untrusted input and scanned for embedded prompt injection.
    - *Verification*: Automated semantic filter scans tool manifests before loading into agent system prompt; zero directive command injections permitted.
- **TRISU-MCP-02 [CRITICAL]**: **Capability Scoping & Minimal Scope**. Agents must negotiate minimal task-specific toolsets; blanket access to entire MCP server tool catalogs is prohibited.
    - *Verification*: Model system prompt in execution trace contains only allowlisted tools declared in `trisuella.config.yaml`.
- **TRISU-MCP-03 [HIGH]**: **Tool Execution Sandboxing**. All tool executions invoking OS commands, shell processes, or database queries must run in isolated ephemeral containers.
    - *Verification*: Container runtime security profile enforces non-root execution and drop-all capabilities except required syscalls.
- **TRISU-MCP-04 [HIGH]**: **Tool Output Sanitization**. Tool execution output data must be sanitized and encapsulated in strict data boundaries before insertion into model context.
    - *Verification*: Data returned by tools is enclosed in `<TOOL_OUTPUT_DATA>` delimiters with zero prompt-authority weighting.
- **TRISU-MCP-05 [HIGH]**: **Recursion & Rate Limits**. Enforce deterministic bounds on recursive autonomous tool-calling loops and cumulative token expenditure.
