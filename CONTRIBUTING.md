## 🛠️ Code of Conduct & Contribution Flow

We aim to maintain a welcoming, inclusive, and professional community. Please review the official **OWASP Code of Conduct** before interacting with the project.

### Step 1: Search and Discuss
Before writing any code, search the repository's active **Issues** and **Pull Requests** to ensure someone else isn't already working on the same item. For significant feature additions, please open a new Issue to discuss the architecture first.

### Step 2: Code Architecture Alignment
Your code must strictly align with the platform's core infrastructure metrics:
* Ensure new rules or invariant checks fit cleanly into one of the **33 Domain Families**.
* Write clear, declarative code. The platform relies on strict deterministic logic to evaluate trust.

### Step 3: Branching & Testing
1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`: `git checkout -b feature/my-amazing-rule`.
2. Add automated unit tests verifying both **positive** (compliance passed) and **negative** (invariant violated) conditions.
3. Run local security linter checks to ensure no vulnerabilities are introduced.

### Step 4: Submit a Clean PR
* Provide a detailed summary of the changes in your PR description.
* Reference the specific Issue number being addressed (e.g., `Closes #104`).
* Ensure your commit log is clean, descriptive, and **DCO signed-off**.
