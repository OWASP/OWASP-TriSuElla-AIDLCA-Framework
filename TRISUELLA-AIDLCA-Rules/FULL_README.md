# TRISUELLA-AIDLCA Secure Development Framework

> **This framework establishes AI as a trusted, policy-governed, multi-role developer that builds, secures, tests, audits, and enforces global compliance across the software lifecycle, while incorporating human-in-the-loop governance to enable context-aware decisions aligned with project intent, functional requirements, and data sensitivity.**

**TriSuElla** is a foundational architectural and governance framework for AI-driven development that establishes a comprehensive, security-first and policy-driven approach to designing, building, and operating systems across the entire lifecycle, ensuring that AI operates not only with autonomous execution but also with enforced trust, regulatory compliance, auditability, and alignment to human intent; it is built on three integrated pillars—Sisu, Tillit, and Dugnad—where Sisu enables intelligent, resilient, and modular execution of development activities through AI agents across planning, design, build, testing, deployment, monitoring, and continuous improvement, Tillit governs all actions through Zero Trust security, multi-jurisdictional compliance including regulations such as DPDPA, GDPR, and HIPAA, and responsible AI principles such as explainability, bias control, validation, risk classification, and human-in-the-loop oversight to ensure trustworthy and context-aware decision-making, and Dugnad enables structured multi-agent and human collaboration through orchestration, communication protocols, shared knowledge systems, and coordinated task execution; the framework enforces policy-as-code governance, continuous testing including SAST, DAST, IAST, and AI output validation, automated threat modeling and risk management, full traceability and auditability of all actions and decisions, and dynamic compliance enforcement across regions, while distinguishing between mandatory rules that must be enforced and advisory guidelines that can be contextually applied with human oversight, ultimately enabling scalable, reusable, and continuously improving AI-driven development systems that are secure, compliant, collaborative, and trustworthy by design.

> **TriSuElla Purpose Statement:**
> TriSuElla exists to ensure that AI-driven development is executed with integrated governance, security, compliance, trust, and collaboration—enabling autonomous systems that are controlled, auditable, and aligned with human, organizational, and regulatory expectations.

## 🧭 Meaning & Symbolism
The name **TriSuElla** represents the convergence of three foundational forces, inspired by the **Trishula** (Trident).

- **Tri** → Three Pillars: **SISU** (Execution), **TILLIT** (Trust), and **DUGNAD** (Collaboration).
- **Symbolism**: Much like each prong of a trident, every pillar represents a core force. Together, they provide **Balance, Control, and Direction**.

> **The Core Philosophy:**
> Power comes not from one capability, but from the balance of three.

**TRISUELLA-AIDLCA (AI-Driven Development Life Cycle)** — A modern methodology for software development that integrates generative AI throughout every stage of the building process: from threat modeling and requirements, through design, code generation, security testing, deployment, and incident response.

**Version**: 3.1.0
**Author**: [Bhaskar Puppala (PATEL)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhaskerkpatel/)
**Last Updated**: 2026-09-12
**Status**: Institutionalized Release (Production-Ready, DevSecOps-Ready & CI-Verified)
**Total Consolidated Checks**: 299 (across 25 sections, 198 unique rules)

---

## 🚦 TriSuElla Severity Scale (Risk-First)
To ensure consistent governance, every rule in the TRISUELLA-AIDLCA ruleset is assigned a **Severity Rating** defining its enforcement priority:

*   **`[CRITICAL]`**: **Immediate systemic risk**. Non-compliance triggers an immediate "Halt" state. Must be resolved before *any* further progress (Atomic/Blocking Finding).
*   **`[HIGH]`**: **Significant operational or security risk**. Must be resolved before the current Phase (Inception/Construction/Operations) can be completed.
*   **`[MEDIUM]`**: **Moderate risk or non-functional violation**. Should be addressed before production release; may be deferred with documented justification.
*   **`[LOW]`**: **Best practice or hygiene finding**. Minor impact on security posture; recommended for long-term maintenance.

## 🛡️ Risk-First AI Security (The 3-Layer Model)
We prioritize security investment where the actual financial and operational loss occurs:

    L3["<b>Layer 3: Technical & Operational Governance</b><br/>(10% Loss Impact - Lifecycle)"]

    style L3 fill:#99ff66,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
    end
```

### 🏗️ The Financial Architecture of the 3-Layer Model
The model is based on the insight that AI systems don't exist in a vacuum; they sit on top of legacy infrastructure and under a governance umbrella.

| Layer | Focus | Est. Loss Impact | Why the "Next Dollar" belongs here: |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Layer 1: Cyber Residual Risk Floor** | Fundamentals: Identity (IAM), Cloud Posture, Patching, Endpoint Security. | **~70%** | **The Baseline:** Even if your LLM is perfectly secure, if an attacker steals the API key because of a misconfigured S3 bucket or an unpatched server, the AI system is compromised. This is where 70% of actual loss occurs in the real world. |
| **Layer 2: AI / App Security** | AI-Native Risks: Prompt Injection, Tool-use boundaries, Agent Sandboxing, Semantic WAFs. | **~20%** | **The New Surface:** This is the layer of "Prompt Injection" and "Excessive Agency." While high-profile, it accounts for a smaller fraction of total financial loss than Layer 1, but it requires specialized, AI-native security tools. |
| **Layer 3: Technical & Operational Governance** | Lifecycle & Oversight: NI-IAM, AI-BoM, Policy-as-Code, Human-in-the-Loop, Audit. | **~10%** | **The Long Game:** This layer manages the "silent failures"—model drift, compliance fines, and operational overreach. It is the cheapest to implement but the most critical for long-term legal and regulatory survival. |

### 🚀 Operational & Financial Benefits
*   **Prevents "Shiny Object Syndrome":** It stops organizations from spending their entire security budget on a "Prompt Injection" tool (Layer 2) while their Cloud IAM (Layer 1) remains wide open.
*   **CISO-Friendly Metrics:** By framing security as "Loss Impact (%)," it transforms AI security from a technical hurdle into a financial risk management discussion.
*   **Sequential Hardening:** The model mandates that an organization MUST harden Layer 1 (The Floor) before it can claim to have a "Secure AI System."

## What Is This?

The TRISUELLA-AIDLCA Secure Development Framework is a **rules kit for AI coding assistants and agent systems**. You load it into your AI tool once — as a system prompt, project instructions, or repository rules file — and every piece of code the AI generates from that point on follows production-grade security, privacy, and compliance standards automatically.

Traditional SDLC treats AI as a code autocomplete tool. TRISUELLA-AIDLCA is different: the AI model is an active participant in *every* phase of development — an architect in Inception, a security analyst in Threat Modeling, a designer in Construction, a QA engineer in Build & Test, and a DevOps engineer in Operations.

The result is a consistent, auditable, secure development workflow that works equally well for solo vibe coders, small teams, and regulated enterprise projects.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Method A: Automated Scaffolding with `trisu-cli` (Recommended)

Run the zero-dependency TriSuElla validator CLI to scaffold drop-in rules, CI gates, and state tracking in 30 seconds:

```bash
# Option 1: Turnkey root wrappers (zero install)
.\trisu.cmd init --target /path/to/my-repo   # Windows
./trisu init --target /path/to/my-repo       # Linux / macOS

# Option 2: Global pip CLI
trisu init --target /path/to/my-repo

# Option 3: Direct python execution
python tools/trisu-cli/trisu_validator.py init --target /path/to/my-repo
```

### Method B: Manual Drop-In Integration

#### Step 1: Copy rules to your project

```bash
# From your project root
cp -r TRISUELLA-AIDLCA-Rules/TRISUELLA-AIDLCA-rule-details /path/to/my-repo/.TRISUELLA-AIDLCA-rule-details
mkdir -p /path/to/my-repo/.TRISUELLA-AIDLCA-rules
cp TRISUELLA-AIDLCA-Rules/TRISUELLA-AIDLCA-rules/core-workflow.md /path/to/my-repo/.TRISUELLA-AIDLCA-rules/core-workflow.md
```

#### Step 2: Activate in your AI assistant / IDE

Every project starts here. The AI detects your workspace, gathers requirements, and — for any security-relevant scope — runs a full threat model before a single line of code is written.

| Stage | Always / Conditional | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Workspace Detection | **Always** | Detect greenfield/brownfield, scan existing code |
| Reverse Engineering | Conditional | Analyse existing codebase if brownfield |
| Requirements Analysis | **Always** | Gather functional + NFRs with adaptive depth |
| **Threat Modeling** | Conditional | STRIDE + STRIDEAI threat analysis, DREAD scoring |
| User Stories | Conditional | User personas and acceptance criteria |
| Workflow Planning | **Always** | Build the execution plan |
| Application Design | Conditional | High-level components and service design |
| Units Generation | Conditional | Decompose into parallel units of work |

### 🟢 Phase 2: Construction — Design, Code, and Verify

Each unit of work goes through design → code → security review before moving on. Build & Test runs once all units are complete.

| Stage | Always / Conditional | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Functional Design | Conditional per unit | Business logic and domain model |
| NFR Requirements | Conditional per unit | Performance, security, scalability NFRs |
| NFR Design | Conditional per unit | NFR patterns and logical components |
| Infrastructure Design | Conditional per unit | Cloud/infra mapping + Secrets Management by Design |
| **Code Generation** | **Always** per unit | Generate code + mandatory 20-item Security Code Review |
| **Build and Test** | **Always** | Unit, integration, performance, SAST, DAST, secrets scan |

### 🟡 Phase 3: Operations — Ship and Operate It

Closes the loop from code to running production system with full observability and incident readiness.

| Stage | Always / Conditional | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| CI/CD Pipeline Generation | Conditional | Pipeline with security/quality gates |
| **Deployment Planning** | **Always** | Strategy, rollback, production readiness checklist |
| Observability Setup | Conditional | Metrics, alerts, dashboards (including AI-specific) |
| Incident Response Planning | Conditional | Runbooks, breach procedures, AI abuse playbook |

## 🔑 Design Principles

| Principle | What It Means in Practice |
|---|---|
| **Adaptive Workflow** | Only execute stages that add real value — a simple bug fix skips threat modeling; a new authentication system runs the full process |
| **Transparent Planning** | The AI shows its execution plan and gets your approval before proceeding to any stage |
| **User Control** | Every stage can be included or excluded on your direction |
| **Shift Left Security** | Threat modeling runs in Inception — before architecture is locked, before code is written |
| **Secure by Default** | Security controls are ON out of the box; less-secure configurations require explicit justification |
| **Privacy by Default** | Maximum privacy protection in every default configuration — analytics, tracking, AI training all off by default |
| **Safety by Design** | Misuse scenarios are documented; AI systems have scope limits, kill switches, and human oversight gates |
| **Zero Trust Native** | Every agent action authenticated, authorized, and audited; no implicit trust based on network location |
| **Complete Audit Trail** | Every user input, AI response, and approval logged to `TRISUELLA-AIDLCA-docs/audit.md` with timestamps |
| **Progress Tracking** | All workflow state in `TRISUELLA-AIDLCA-docs/TRISUELLA-AIDLCA-state.md` — resume any session from where it left off |
| **Platform Agnostic** | Works with any AI assistant, any OS, any cloud provider |

## 🤖 For Vibe Coders and First-Time Developers

You do not need to understand every rule to benefit from this framework. The workflow is designed so the AI does the analysis — you describe what you want, answer a few questions, and approve each stage.

**Minimal setup:**
1. Copy the rules folder into your project root (see Quick Setup above)
2. Tell your AI assistant: *"Follow the TRISUELLA-AIDLCA workflow in `.TRISUELLA-AIDLCA-rules/core-workflow.md`"*
3. Describe what you want to build
4. Answer the questions the AI asks
5. Review and approve each stage

**What you get without any extra effort:**
- Structured requirements before code is written
- An execution plan you approve before construction starts
- Every generated function checked against a 20-item security checklist
- Build and test instructions generated for your specific tech stack
- A production readiness checklist before you ship

**See the dedicated guide**: [`docs/vibe-coding-guide.md`](docs/vibe-coding-guide.md)
